### Hello there 👋

My name is Simon and I love Star Wars & gaming.

- 🔭 I’m currently working at DGK.ca as a Senior Web Developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js (3) mostly. Always learning about Laravel and PHP. I try to stay up-to-date on C# and CSS as much as possible.
- 💬 Ask me about: Laravel or VueJS
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

I should do more open-source huh!

I worked on several projects such as https://www.spypoint.com/en, https://mikeward.ca/en and more. I've worked with schools and corporate clients. If you ever need help with anything just ask 😁
