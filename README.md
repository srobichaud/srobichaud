### Hello there 👋

My name is Simon and I love gaming, coding and F1.

- 🔭 I’m currently working at DGK.ca as a Senior Web Developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Alpine.js mostly. Always learning about Laravel and PHP. I try to stay up-to-date on dotnet and CSS as much as possible.
- 💬 Ask me about: Laravel or Alpine.js
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

I worked on several projects such as https://www.spypoint.com/en, https://mikeward.ca/en and more. I've worked with schools and corporate clients. If you ever need help with anything just ask 😁
